Some of the major challenges would be

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {
		\textbf{Minimal messages between clients}
		
		To decrease latency and improve overall throughput and utilize more bandwidth, the number of messages sent and received between clients should be as low as possible.
	}

	\item {
		\textbf{Balanced Stages}
		
		Keeping the stages balanced in terms of computation time so that no stage is too fast or too slow for the other nodes.
	}

	\item {
		\textbf{Debugging}
		
		Debugging the pipeline in case of any breakdown or inconsistency
	}

	\item {
		\textbf{Fault Tolerance}
		
		Fault tolerance in case the server goes down or one of the stages goes down.	
	}
	
\end{enumerate}
