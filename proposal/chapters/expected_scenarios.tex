There are three expected scenarios

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {
		\textbf{Minimal Case:} Build the pipeline and run one application successfully.
	}

	\item {
		\textbf{Expected Case:} Along with the minimal case, run the second application successfully
	}

	\item {
		\textbf{Best Case:} Along with the expected case report the network status of the system.
	}
\end{enumerate}
